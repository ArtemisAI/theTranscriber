YouTube Transcript Retrieval Service – Technical and Business Requirements
Executive Summary
As video content proliferates, internal teams increasingly need efficient access to YouTube video transcripts. This project will deliver an on-premise FastAPI-based service that searches YouTube and extracts transcripts using the open-source youtube-transcript-api library. By providing transcripts in text, JSON, or SRT format via REST endpoints, the service will streamline research, AI-driven analysis (e.g. summarization), and content workflows. It will support integration with internal agents (such as n8n workflows or an MCP server), and run securely on our infrastructure using Docker Compose. Authentication or monetization are deferred to later phases, but are noted for future extensibility.
Business Justification
YouTube hosts vast amounts of up-to-date information, but manually watching videos is time-consuming and inefficient. As one study notes, “finding relevant information within lengthy videos can be time-consuming,” and automated transcript tools “facilitate the extraction of video transcripts” to aid summarization and analysis
publications.scrs.in
. Internally, this service will enable teams to integrate video content into analytics pipelines and AI agents, speeding research and decision-making. By building it in-house, we avoid vendor lock-in and control costs. The service will replace manual transcript fetching, saving labor, and enable new use cases (e.g. auto-summarization or knowledge base updates). Key Benefits:
Efficiency: Automates transcript retrieval, eliminating manual downloading.
Integration: Provides machine-friendly outputs (JSON/SRT) for AI, BI tools, or internal workflows (n8n/MCP).
Control & Compliance: On-premise deployment ensures data control and leverages existing infrastructure.
Cost Management: Uses free libraries and public YouTube Data API; default quota (10,000 units/day
developers.google.com
) suffices for initial needs.
Functional Requirements
Video Search Endpoint (/search)
Function: Search YouTube for videos by keywords.
Inputs: Query text (q), optional parameters (maxResults, pageToken).
Operation: Calls YouTube Data API’s search.list method (quota cost 100 units per call
developers.google.com
) to retrieve matching video snippets.
Outputs: JSON list of videos (IDs, titles, descriptions, etc.) matching the query. Returns HTTP 200 with results or an empty list if none found.
Transcript Retrieval Endpoints (/transcripts)
Single/Multiple Video IDs:
Accepts one or more YouTube video IDs (query param or JSON body).
Uses youtube-transcript-api to fetch each video’s transcript (including auto-generated subtitles
github.com
).
Returns transcripts in the requested format (text, json, or srt).
Bulk Playlist Retrieval (/playlists/{playlistId}/transcripts):
Given a YouTube playlist ID, calls YouTube Data API’s playlistItems.list (quota cost 1 unit per call
developers.google.com
) to list videos.
Fetches transcripts for all videos in the playlist. Returns combined results.
Output Formats
Text: Plain text transcript (one line per snippet).
JSON: List of snippets with fields { "text": ..., "start": ..., "duration": ... } per video. For example, a transcript JSON might include segments like {"text":"Hello world","start":0.0,"duration":2.5}
github.com
.
SRT: Standard subtitle format, one file per video (seconds to hh:mm:ss,ms format).
The youtube-transcript-api provides built-in formatters (JSONFormatter, TextFormatter, SRTFormatter) for these outputs
github.com
.
Clients can request format via a query parameter (e.g. ?format=srt) or Accept header. The API returns data with appropriate Content-Type (e.g. application/json or text/plain).
Integration & Accessibility
Internal Agents: The service exposes standard REST endpoints, making it straightforward for n8n, MCP clients, or other internal tools to invoke via HTTP requests. (For example, an n8n HTTP Request node can call /search?q=keyword.)
On-Premise Deployment: All components run on our local infrastructure via Docker Compose, ensuring data never leaves our network.
Non-Functional Requirements
Technology Stack: Python 3.9+, FastAPI framework
dev.to
, youtube-transcript-api library (no API key needed for transcripts
github.com
), Redis (for caching).
Containerization: Use Docker Compose to manage services. Docker Compose allows defining the entire multi-container setup (API server, Redis, etc.) in one YAML file
docs.docker.com
. This simplifies on-prem deployment and scaling of individual components.
Performance & Scalability: The API should handle concurrent requests (using FastAPI’s async capabilities) and scale horizontally if needed.
Caching: Use Redis to cache transcripts (keyed by video ID) and optionally search results. Cached transcripts can have long TTLs (transcripts rarely change). This reduces external calls and improves latency.
Quotas & Rate Limiting: Use the YouTube Data API key (Google Developer Console) for searches and playlist queries
developers.google.com
. Monitor usage against the default 10,000/day quota
developers.google.com
. Implement basic rate limiting or request batching if we approach quota limits.
Logging & Observability: Implement structured logging (INFO/WARN/ERROR) and metrics. Expose Prometheus metrics (e.g. request counts, latencies, error rates) to support monitoring. As one guide notes, “monitoring plays a crucial role in ensuring the performance, availability, and stability of FastAPI applications”
dev.to
.
Error Handling: Use proper HTTP status codes (400 for bad request, 404 if video/playlist not found, 500 for server errors). Return JSON error messages. Handle exceptions (e.g. transcript not available) gracefully per request.
Configuration: All keys and settings (e.g. YOUTUBE_API_KEY, cache TTL, logging levels) should be configurable via environment variables or a config file.
Security (Future): While initial versions omit auth, the design should allow adding authentication (API keys, OAuth) later. Similarly, monetize features (e.g. usage tiers) can be considered after core launch.
Technical Architecture
The service follows a simple microservice architecture. Key components:
FastAPI Server (API Service): Hosts REST endpoints. Written in Python, leveraging FastAPI’s async support for high throughput
dev.to
. Automatically generates OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for ease of use
dev.to
.
Transcript Module: Uses the youtube-transcript-api library to fetch and format transcripts. This module handles calls to YouTube and formats outputs using built-in JSONFormatter, TextFormatter, SRTFormatter
github.com
.
YouTube Data Client: Internal component that calls YouTube Data API (via google-api-python-client or HTTP) for search and playlist lookups. Requires a Google API key, subject to quotas
developers.google.com
developers.google.com
.
Cache Layer (Redis): Stores recently fetched transcripts (keyed by video ID) and possibly recent search queries. This cache reduces load on YouTube APIs and speeds repeated requests.
Observability Stack: Integrates Prometheus client libraries for metrics and standard Python logging (to file or stdout). Optionally, push logs to a central log collector.
Container Orchestration: Docker Compose brings up the above containers together. This ensures easy on-premise deployment, consistent configuration, and isolated environments
docs.docker.com
.
Figure 1 (Architecture Diagram, conceptual):
A client (e.g. n8n or MCP agent) makes HTTP requests to the FastAPI service. The FastAPI app routes calls to internal modules: if it’s a search request, it calls YouTube Data API; if it’s a transcript request, it checks Redis cache and uses youtube-transcript-api to fetch data as needed. Results are cached and returned to the client. The service emits logs and exposes metrics on a /metrics endpoint. (This figure would show boxes for Client → API Service → {YT Data API, Transcript Library, Redis, Logging/Monitoring}.) Component Breakdown:
Component	Function	Technology / Notes
FastAPI Service	Core REST API handling requests.	Python, FastAPI (async), Uvicorn/Gunicorn as server.
YouTube Search	Queries YouTube for videos by keyword.	YouTube Data API (v3) client, uses search.list (100 unit cost
developers.google.com
). Requires API key
developers.google.com
.
Playlist Fetcher	Lists videos in a playlist.	YouTube Data API playlistItems.list (1 unit cost
developers.google.com
).
Transcript Engine	Retrieves and formats transcripts for videos.	youtube-transcript-api library (no API key needed
github.com
). Supports JSON, text, SRT formats
github.com
.
Cache (Redis)	Caches transcripts/search results.	Redis container managed by Docker Compose. Used for performance.
Metrics & Logging	Tracks usage and health.	Prometheus (metrics endpoint), Python logging (INFO/ERROR).
Clients (n8n/MCP)	Internal consumers of the API.	Any HTTP-capable agent (e.g. n8n HTTP node, custom scripts).
API Specification
The REST API follows a clear, self-documented structure (FastAPI auto-generates docs). Key endpoints include:
Endpoint	Method	Description	Input Parameters	Output Formats
/search	GET	Search YouTube videos by query	q (string, required), maxResults, pageToken	JSON list of video metadata
/transcripts	GET	Get transcript(s) by video ID(s)	id (string, one or more IDs, required), format (text/json/srt)	Text, JSON, or SRT content
/transcripts	POST	(Alternate) Bulk transcript retrieval	JSON body: { "ids": [id1, id2, ...], "format": "json" }	As above
/playlists/{playlistId}/transcripts	GET	Fetch transcripts for all videos in a playlist	playlistId (string, required), format	Text, JSON, or SRT for each video
Notes:
For /transcripts, multiple IDs can be comma-separated (GET) or passed as an array in JSON (POST).
Responses include HTTP 200 with content on success, 400 for bad inputs, 404 if a video/playlist is not found, and 500 on server errors.
JSON transcripts have structure:
{
  "videoId": "abc123",
  "transcript": [
    { "text": "Hello world", "start": 0.0, "duration": 2.5 },
    { "text": "How are you?", "start": 2.5, "duration": 1.8 }
  ]
}
(This corresponds to the library’s FetchedTranscript snippets
github.com
.)
Caching and Performance
To ensure low latency and reduce external calls:
Transcript Caching: After fetching a transcript, store it in Redis (e.g. key=transcript:{videoId}). On subsequent requests for the same video, return cached content instead of calling YouTube again. TTL can be set very high or indefinitely, as transcripts rarely change.
Search Caching: Optionally cache recent search queries with their results (short TTL). Useful if users repeat queries.
Concurrency: Use FastAPI’s async endpoints. Fetch multiple transcripts in parallel (e.g. with asyncio.gather) to speed up bulk requests. Limit concurrency (configurable) to avoid overwhelming the server or YouTube API.
Batch Handling: For large playlists (hundreds of videos), process in batches and stream results if needed. Consider paginating or allowing clients to request subsets to avoid timeouts.
Resource Limits: Monitor memory usage (transcripts can be large). If needed, impose a max duration or result size per request.
Connection Management: Reuse HTTP sessions for YouTube Data API calls. Respect YouTube rate limits (per-second quota); implement retries with backoff on HTTP 429 responses.
Configuration and Quotas
YouTube API Key: Obtain from Google Cloud Console
developers.google.com
. Store securely as an environment variable (e.g. YOUTUBE_API_KEY). The key should have YouTube Data API v3 enabled.
Quota Management: Default YouTube Data API quota is 10,000 units/day
developers.google.com
. Each search costs 100 units
developers.google.com
, each playlist fetch costs 1 unit
developers.google.com
. Plan usage accordingly (e.g. limit maxResults, avoid unnecessary repeated searches). If higher quota needed, prepare for Google’s audit process
developers.google.com
.
Environment Variables (examples):
YOUTUBE_API_KEY – Google API key (string).
REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT – Redis configuration (if using separate host).
CACHE_TTL – Time-to-live for cached transcripts (seconds).
LOG_LEVEL – Logging verbosity.
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS – Limit for simultaneous transcript fetches.
Error Handling and Observability
Errors: Validate inputs; return 400 Bad Request for malformed parameters. If a YouTube lookup fails (video not found or caption disabled), return 404 Not Found with a clear message. For unexpected errors, return 500 Internal Server Error and log details. Bulk endpoints should indicate per-video failures.
Logging: Implement structured logs (timestamp, level, message, request ID). Log key events: incoming requests, external API calls, cache hits/misses, errors.
Metrics: Expose Prometheus metrics at /metrics. Track: request counts per endpoint, success/error counts, request latency histograms, cache hit rate, external API call counts. As noted, monitoring is critical for performance and stability
dev.to
. Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize these metrics.
Health Checks: Provide a /health endpoint that checks dependencies (e.g. Redis connectivity, maybe a quick YT API ping) and returns overall status.
Extensibility and Future Phases
The design should allow adding features later:
Authentication/Authorization: In a future phase, implement API keys or OAuth to restrict access (especially if exposing externally). Initially, the service can be unprotected on an internal network.
Monetization: Not needed now, but could later limit usage or integrate billing if offered outside.
Additional Formats: Could add other formats (e.g. WebVTT) via the library’s formatters.
Additional Metadata: Optionally include video metadata (author, publish date) in responses by calling additional YouTube API methods.
Summarization or NLP: Future services could use the transcripts (e.g. summarize text, index content in an internal search engine). Our design should allow easy integration (for example, returning transcripts to an n8n workflow that then calls an NLP service).
Error Reporting: Integrate with an alerting/incident system (e.g. Sentry) for production errors.
