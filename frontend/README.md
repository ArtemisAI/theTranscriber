# Frontend â€“ Minimal React UI (Vite)

This folder hosts a *very* lightweight React (TypeScript) application built
with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).  Its sole purpose is to demonstrate how the
backend API can be consumed; the interface may evolve in future sprints.

Run locally:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server listens on `http://localhost:5173` by default.  Make sure the
backend (`docker compose up`) is running so that API requests succeed.
